    "review" : "Overall, The mouse is phenomenal. Build quality is stellar, it is super light, and incredibly comfortable to use.I love this mouse. My hands measure at 17x9.5 and i can comfortably relaxed claw it with absolutely no fatigue. The paracord is the most flexible i have seen in a stock cable, and every button and click feels wonderful.If you are into wide mice and play FPS this may be your mouse. If you play other games and am interested in this mouse, get it, it will NOT disappoint. The build quality is incredible.",

    "review" : "Its one of the best Mid range psu. i think this psu  focused on performance and usability on this specific model. packaging was well enough tho you can notice antec cut out some bucks to make this affordable. this semi modular functionality is as good as a fully modular one ( only the 24pin ATX and 8 pic CPU are not removable ) . good for builds with small space.",
